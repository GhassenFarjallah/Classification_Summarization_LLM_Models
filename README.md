# Classification_Summarization_LLM_Models for Enron Fraud Email Dataset
We used 4 models for both classification and Summarization tasks (Phi3, Sablelem zephyr, Minitron and H2O )
 * Summarization Task :
   - The dataset found was not annotated with the reference summary so we used pegasus model for getting that reference. We used prompts for each model to compare the performance of each model on different formulations.
* Classification Task :
   - The dataset found was annotated with Spam or Ham and we compared the performance of these 4 models on the different formulations of prompts.
